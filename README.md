Local Co-Op competitive arena shooter created within a small team for Portsmouth Uni Game Jam 2018  

Game is 2.5D arena shooter where up to four players need to race to the plunger, first one who reaches it wins the round. Players can pick up a number of different weapons found within crates scattered through the levels to use on each other and AI enemies.

For this project I mainly worked on weapon scripts with setting them up to allow for new weapons to be created and implemented easily. Also worked on the object pooling as well as some of the AI behaviour and player controls.
